# Visual Product Matcher

For my Visual Product Matcher project, I developed a user-friendly web application that enables users to find products visually similar to an uploaded image. The frontend is designed to handle both file uploads and image URL inputs, providing a seamless user experience. Once an image is uploaded, the interface displays it alongside a list of visually similar products retrieved from a curated database containing over 50 products, each with metadata including name, category, and image. Users can filter results based on similarity scores, helping them quickly locate the closest matches. The application emphasizes responsiveness and accessibility, ensuring smooth performance across devices, including mobile screens. The layout is clean and intuitive, with a focus on clear visualization of uploaded images and search results. The project demonstrates practical implementation of image-based search in e-commerce contexts and is deployed live on a free hosting platform, making it easily accessible for users to explore and interact with.
